<p>In recent years, Portland, Oregon has become known across the nation and in the media as a hub for sex trafficking. Currently in Oregon, there is no long-term home where a sex trafficking survivor over 18 can stay and receive restorative care and rehabilitation, specific to her needs. When an adult survivor leaves the streets and doesn’t have a safe place to live or can’t receive the physical, psychological and emotional care she needs, she will more than likely return to the streets and to her trafficker. This cycle lowers her chances of survival and only perpetuates the issue.</p>

<blockquote class="poem">
“What people don’t understand is the meaning of being trafficked.<br>
What they need to know is, it’s not a choice.<br>
You can’t tell what’s going on by looking at a ‘hoe’.<br>
Pimps control what they think, eat, wear and sleep.<br>
They control their every move.<br>
As someone who has lived it, I am lifting my voice and will be heard.<br>
No one, no longer controls my every move.<br>
I will help the other girls who are where I once was.<br>
So bring this battle, because I’ll fight it for me and those girls who can’t.<br>
Even if it’s just bringing awareness.<br>
The girls out there deserve freedom, not to be beat and controlled.”<br>

<h2>Preempting Innocence</h2>

<blockquote>“Growing up like, I really don’t remember most of it. I really don’t remember anything since I was like 12 or younger. My mind blocked it out because my body doesn’t want to remember it.”</blockquote>
<p class="blockquote-caption"><i>&mdash; Mariah, survivor</i></p>

<p>Mariah does not remember much before age 12. What she does remember is her grandma visiting and bringing gum for her and her brother. The missing pieces of Mariah’s childhood are detailed in court documents. She clings to the memories of her grandma, warm and kind, while blocking out all memories of her mom selling her to strangers for methamphetamine. </p>

<p>“My mind blocked it out because my body doesn’t want to remember it,” Mariah said. </p>

<p>Her freckled skin is decorated with several small tattoos and her hot pink nail polish is chipped. When she smiles, you no longer see a large gap where her two front teeth used to be. Instead, a full set of white teeth smile back at you for the first time since she was 14. Now, at 19, she is still working on learning how to be confident and what it means to have control of her own life and identity.</p>

<p>At age six, Mariah was taken out of foster care to live with her dad and stepmom. She remembers feeling like she couldn’t connect with her dad and found refuge in the friendship of her grandma. When her grandma suddenly passed away, Mariah turned to drugs and partying as a way to cope. She frequented raves and lived according to her own rules as a teenager. </p>

<p>Jennifer Unangst, the founder of House of Engedi, a safe home soon to open in Oregon for sex trafficking survivors, knows from experience how a childhood of trauma can prime a girl for a lifetime of abuse. </p>

<p>“My dad was a raging alcoholic and he was very abusive to my sister and I. It’s very traumatic to a child. It devalued me and I had no self-worth. I didn’t feel important, I felt very unloved. And so I sought love out in the wrong ways as a teen,” Jennifer said.</p>

<p>As a teen, Jennifer turned to drugs to numb the pain. When her addiction to methamphetamine became her only relief, she began to sell her body to drug dealers and strangers to support her habit. </p>

<p>For Mariah, growing up in world where drugs and abuse were merely ornaments of normality, survival was her daily objective. </p>

<h4>What is trafficking?</h4>
The 2013 Trafficking in Persons report defines sex trafficking as this:

When an adult is coerced, forced, or deceived into prostitution, or maintained in prostitution through one of these means after initially consenting, that person is a victim of trafficking. Under such circumstances, perpetrators involved in recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for that purpose are responsible for trafficking crimes. Sex trafficking may also occur within debt bondage, as women and girls are forced to continue in prostitution through the use of unlawful “debt” purportedly incurred through their transportation, recruitment, or even their crude “sale” - which exploiters insist they must pay off before they can be free. Trafficking in Persons Report, 2013.

<p>One evening on the way to a party, Mariah and her friend wound-up stranded at a convenient store in Portland. Mariah’s friend called a friend, she had recently met, for a ride. The man picked the two girls up in his Lincoln and took them back to his place where they stayed the night. Mariah quickly became friends with the man and in the months that followed, began to open up to him. He was charming, supportive and gave Mariah a reliable place to stay.</p>

<p>“One day when something really bad happened to me, I called him for a ride because I knew no one else who would help,” Mariah said. “I remember we were eating ice cream together on his couch that night when he told me he loved me.” </p>

<p>These were not words that Mariah often heard, so she responded, “I love you too.” 
“He was older, but that didn’t matter to me.” </p>

<p>He was 45 and she was 15.</p>

<p>He knew her deepest secrets. He knew that she came from a broken home, but that her father was the only person she would protect. He knew the depths of her vulnerability.</p>

<p>He handed her a pair of tiny shorts and white, satin heels and sent her out with several other girls. This was her first night of “training.”</p>

<h3>Sex Trafficking in the U.S.</h3>

<p>“We have this idea of sex trafficking as happening in a third world country where a 7-year-old girl is handcuffed to a bed then stuffed in a cargo ship in Cambodia. The problem is, that’s not at all what human trafficking looks like in America,” Rebecca Bender, a sex trafficking survivor and advocate said while leading a class on human trafficking at Oregon State University. </p>

<p>“We’re not Cambodia, we’re a developed, modernized, civilized country and trafficking looks very different in the U.S. than it does in a third world country. The media creates this defined box of what sex trafficking looks like.”</p>

<p>She continued to explain, “When you’re being victimized, because you’re not fitting in this same box, you’re not screaming, “help me, help me,” because you’re thinking, I’m not seven years old handcuffed to a bed, so I must not be trafficked. As victims, we equally have this same misperception of what human trafficking should look like, so we don’t identify as victims.”</p>

<p>Rebecca met her trafficker at Taylor’s bar at the University of Oregon in Eugene when she was 18. She dated him for months before he took her to Las Vegas and forced her into prostitution on the streets and in hotels. He justified his reasoning by reminding her of the debt she owed him for their apartment and their move to Las Vegas. </p>

<p>The man that Mariah had thought “loved” her, was really a violent pimp, similar to Rebecca’s trafficker. Day and night, he forced Mariah and several other women (many minors at the time), to walk 82nd venue and work the hotels of Portland, engaging in sex acts with strangers in exchange for money.</p>

<p>“No matter how much money we made, he wanted more. He was always like, more money, more money. He wanted to have the best clothes, the best cars. He wanted the best of everything and no money was enough for him,” Mariah said.
“I never got no money. It came to the fact that if we wanted to brush our teeth, we would have to go steal the toothbrushes and toothpaste.”</p>

<p>Rebecca survived similar experiences as Mariah, which she now uses as a tool for teaching about sex trafficking.</p>

<p>“It ended up being that traffickers stay right outside of the door for a reason and it’s not to make sure that you’re safe or to do anything that you don’t want to do. It’s to ensure that they get every single dollar when you come out of the room. They take you back to the car and strip-search you. If you were even found with maybe five dollars put aside to get something to eat, you were beaten. It becomes extreme terror, brutality and control,” Rebecca said. </p>

<p>According to the National Institute of Justice, The United Nations defines human trafficking as the “recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by improper means (such as force, abduction, fraud, or coercion) for an improper purpose including forced labor or sexual exploitation.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth Alston, house director and case manager for House of Engedi, breaks the definition of sex trafficking down to simpler terms by stating that, “sex trafficking is when a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud or coercion. So a commercial sex act is a good, service or money for a sex act. If a woman trades a sex act for a sandwich, a good was exchanged. It can be prosecuted under the definition of sex trafficking.”</p>

<p>A powerful tactic traffickers use to keep girls under their control is coercion. 
“It’s often hard for people to understand coercion because we don’t necessarily see it. It’s not always beating a girl and holding her against her will,” Bender said.</p>

<p>Some examples of coercion as defined by the Women’s Crisis Center of Grants Pass, OR are: “I took all the of money so that she depended on me for everything” or,
“I told her how fat and ugly she was all the time and how badly she did things around the house. I told her how embarrassed I was of her.”</p>

<p>Mariah’s remembers clearly how her trafficker would use both violence and coercion to keep her in his control.</p>

<p>“I remember I wasn’t listening to what he was telling me, and so one night he actually took me into the bathroom and he made me look in the mirror, over and over and tell myself that I was ugly, and he cut my face with a razor blade and I still live with the scar to this day,” Mariah said.</p>

<h3>The Holes in Oregon Laws</h3>

<p>Until 2013, Oregon did not differentiate between minors and adults for prostitution. </p>
 
<p>“Up until last year in Oregon, it was only a misdemeanor to purchase sex from a child. So you could rape a child or molest a child, and it was a felony, you had to register as a sex offender, but if you tucked a five dollar bill in that kid’s pocket, you could say that child was engaging in prostitution and it was a misdemeanor, a $3,000 fine, no felony and no registration as a sex offender,” Alston said. </p>

<p>In 2013 in Multnomah County, Oregon, there were 29 girls sitting in juvenile detention for prostitution (Bender). 
“How does a 13-year-old girl drive herself up and down the I-5? How does a 13-year-old girl rent her own hotel room?” Bender said. </p>

<p>“So when Washington and California have really good laws, where do you think the traffickers are going if they know that if a 13-year-old girl gets picked up by the cops she’s thrown into jail? They’re going to make stops right off the I-5 in Oregon.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t until Senate Bill 673 passed in Oregon in August 2013 that purchasing a child for sex became a felony. </p>

<h3>Surviving</h3>

<p>It’s late 2012 and police officer, Jeff Ruppel, answers his phone. It’s Mariah. The two had talked regularly in prior months. Sometimes she called to say hi, other times she called confiding about how violent her trafficker was.</p>

<p>As Jeff recalls, Mariah wanted to leave the life, but was too scared to walk away because of her trafficker’s control. Her trafficker threatened her life and her father’s life, one time cornering her father in a 7-11, while Mariah watched from the car. </p>

<p>What Summer did not realize, was that Jeff, an officer for the East Precinct Prostitution Team in Portland, was building a case on her trafficker. He had run into Mariah multiple times in Portland over the course of two years and built a trusting relationship with her. </p>

<p>In early 2013, the team had enough evidence to arrest Mariah’s trafficker. Jeff called Mariah and asked if she would testify against her pimp in court with several other victims. </p>

<p>“The only reason I got out was because of Jeff and his team… When Jeff called and asked me if I would go to court and testify, I really just wanted to stay out of it,” Mariah said. “Jeff was the only cop I’ve talked to. Just because I trusted Jeff, because he showed me he wasn’t going anywhere… I went to grand jury.”</p>

<p>In order to testify in court, Mariah had to get clean off of methamphetamine. Although she had not relied heavily on drugs while she was with her trafficker, when he was arrested, she turned to meth to numb her pain.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it (meth) while I was with him, but I did it to cover him up,” Mariah said.
“I struggle with PTSD now. I’m even scared to go out in the dark because of him.”</p>

<p>Remarkably, Mariah was able to stay clean in order to testify in court. She remembers crying to her attorney for 48 minutes outside of the courtroom, scared to see her trafficker. She remembers seeing embarrassing photos and videos of herself that were shown as evidence in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Mariah’s bravery and will to survive, along with the testimonies of several other women, helped put their trafficker away for life, without the possibility or parole. </p>

<p>This was the longest sentence ever given to a trafficker in the U.S. and has set new standards for the prosecution of traffickers and buyers of sex.</p>

<h2>A New Life</h2>

<p>The heavy, wooden door opens and the warm walls painted with teals and blues engulf Jennifer. She moves into the living room, flipping on the light switch, revealing a fireplace, large paisley rug and lengthy, turquoise curtains. Going into the kitchen, she opens the cherry cupboards and sets coffee mugs on the granite countertop. Once she starts the coffee pot, Jennifer climbs up the winding staircase to turn on the lights in the three bedrooms. Each bedroom has two or three twin beds adorned with colorful throws and patterned comforters, folded back uniformly. Large vases resplendent with fresh flowers sit on the nightstands.  Jennifer adjusts a pillow on top the red floral comforter, angling it so it matches the others. </p>

<p>“Okay,” she sighs, “I think it’s ready.”</p>

<p>When Jennifer was 17 and hit rock bottom, living on the streets and selling her body for drugs, she was given a phone number for the Bethany House, a safe home for homeless women and children. </p>

<p>“I didn’t want to go to this program, but I had to. It was life or death,” Jennifer remembers. “It was amazing to come off the streets having lived a whole life of abuse and darkness and walk into a home where I was completely welcomed and loved. That experience has really given me a passion to want to do the same for girls.”</p>

<p>After graduating the program at Bethany House, Jennifer began a career and started a family. </p>

<p>In 2011, while attending the Cornerstone School of Ministry in Corvallis, she realized she wanted to open a home for sexually exploited women. After doing research, she found out there were no programs for women over 18 in the state of Oregon.  This motivated Jennifer to form a board and start a 501(c)(3), which evolved into the non-profit, House of Engedi. </p>

<p>“Engedi is a desert oasis right on the Dead Sea in Israel. And that’s what we hope to be, an oasis for women,” Josh Armentano, the executive director of House of Engedi said.</p>

<p>After creating a website for House of Engedi, Jennifer received an email from an anonymous donor who wanted to help the home with startup costs. Jennifer responded, expecting a small donation. When she received a check in the mail from the donor several weeks later, she was floored.</p>

<p>“It was a miracle. We were given a very large gift to start our program. It was completely a miracle.”</p>

<p>Jennifer was in shock. The donation was enough to open a home for sexually exploited women. </p>

<p>In recent years, many organizations in Oregon have tried to open similar homes, but have always hit a dead end due to a lack of funding. There are currently homes for minors that are supported with government funding in Oregon, but those over 18 are falling through the cracks.</p>

<p>In late spring 2013, Jennifer was contacted by the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Portland, Oregon about an 18-year-old girl who was recently rescued from the streets and needed a place to live. With no established home in which to place the young woman, Jennifer was able to find a couple that temporarily donated their cottage to the survivor, Mariah.</p>

<p>“When I met Mariah, she was functioning at the emotional and social level of a 13-year-old. It’s because she was that young when she began on the streets,” Jennifer said. “She didn’t want to be alone. I had to spend every minute with her when she came to me.”</p>

<p>“House of Engedi didn’t have a house yet, but I just didn’t care, anywhere was better than where I was,” Mariah said about life after her trafficker was incarcerated. “But I was still homeless, still wondering where I was going to sleep. I was in my survival mode. I was trying to figure out how was I going to survive.”</p>

<p>Adjusting to a new life away from Portland and her trafficker was tough for Mariah. From June to November 2013, Mariah moved over half a dozen times to different transition homes and even stayed in a motel for a short while. She had a hard time maintaining relationships and adapting to a new way of living. </p>

<p>“These women haven’t had any stability in their lives, ever. They’ve never had rules that they’ve had to follow. They’re not programed to follow the rules of a program or to be living in one place,” Jeff said about survivors after the life. “And when they do have a secure living situation, then there’s other issues they have to deal with, such as maybe a mental health issue or PTSD. And that’s usually enough to make these girls bail and go somewhere else. They’re used to chaos, so that’s what they’re comfortable with.”</p>

<h3>A Home for Survivors</h3>

<p>Currently, there is no place in Oregon where adult survivors of sex trafficking can live long-term. There are domestic violence shelters and homeless shelters that are tailored for those types of traumas, but no home where sex trafficking survivors can live and receive treatment specific to their trauma. </p>

<p>“We need to teach these women life skills. They don’t know how to save money because they’ve been giving all their money to their pimps all their life. They don’t understand stuff that we take for granted like, if you have a bill you need to pay it,” Jeff said. “And then there’s the mental health aspect. These women have been involved in very traumatic circumstances for most of their adolescence and even their adult life. If these issues aren’t addressed there’s the possibility of them going right back into that lifestyle.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth Alston, the house director and case manager for House of Engedi has worked to develop a three-phase program that will help restore the years many of these women lost, from 12-18 years of age. </p>

<p>“The average age of entry into the life is 12-14. So can you imagine if these girls are 12-14 years-old and that’s when they’re entering prostitution, where are their brains formatively? Can they think concretely? No. When they enter this young, psychologically, it’s almost like it freezes their brains right there. So we’re dealing with adult women who are thinking on a 12-14 year-old age level,” Elizabeth said. </p>

<p>The goal is to teach the women the social and emotional skills they would have learned from 12-18 within 18 months. </p>

<p>Phase one is designed to restore the years 12-14. Elizabeth explains that from 12-14, girls have some privileges. They start thinking about what they may want to be when they grow up; they are learning how to form healthy friendships and are focused on going to school.</p>

<p>Phase two is directed toward restoring years 14-16. The girls/women have more privileges. They can leave the house with approved residents and work on their G.E.Ds or explore career options.</p>

<p>Phase three is moving toward restoring years 16-18. The women have more freedoms. They can have a phone and regularly leave the house. They can start taking college classes or begin working. </p>

<p>“We are there to create stability. You get nutritious meals every day. You are going to be able to eat when you feel like your body needs it. You are going to be able to sleep at night and not constantly have to be on guard. And so we’re really meeting some basic needs before we dive into counseling,” Elizabeth explains. </p>

<h3>Hope For Mariah</h3>

<p>I’m driving with Mariah over the Morrison Bridge into downtown Portland. She looks out the window over the river and comments on how stressed she is.</p>

<p>“I’m basically homeless. I don’t have a job and it’s hard because sometimes I just think I could go hoe and then things would be okay,” Mariah said.</p>

<p>I ask her about her boyfriend and what living with her aunt has been like.  </p>

<p>“It sucks,” she says. “My Aunt won’t let us stay at the house during the day when she is at work.” </p>

<p>It’s very apparent that she clings to the security of her boyfriend. She clings to the affection and companionship. </p>

<p>As we drive, we joke about the first time we met and how she’s always been fond of Jeff Ruppel, the police officer. She says that she’s been sober for 11 months. I hope this is true.</p>

<p>Mariah moved back to Portland in late December 2013. Jennifer hopes that when House of Engedi opens in April 2014, she will consider moving into the home. </p>

<p>“Statistics from other safe homes in U.S. show that a woman may go back seven or eight times before they come around and get the help that they need,” Jennifer said. </p>

<p>I pull up to a coffee shop in downtown Portland and Mariah eagerly jumps out, before I have time to park. She’s sees Jennifer at a table through the glass door.</p>

<p>“Jennifer!” Mariah shrieks.</p>

<p>“Hi honey, I’ve missed you!” Jennifer replies, as they embrace in a hug.</p>

<p>The two are like giddy children. They go inside and Mariah orders a large caramel latté with extra whipped cream. She immediately spills it on her shirt, but licks it off without thinking twice. </p>

<p>The two women laugh. They joke about old times. An hour or two passes and Mariah gets antsy when country music comes on the coffee shop radio.  </p>

<p>“Let’s go smoke a cig,” Mariah says as she walks out the doors.</p>

<p>“Please be good. Please be safe,” Jennifer whispers in Mariah’s ear.</p>

<p>“I will,” Mariah says to Jennifer, with a saddened expression</p>

<p>The two part ways.</p>
